# Conway's Game of Life

Basic implementation in Python using numpy and matplotlib libraries.

The rules:
---------

For a space that is 'populated':
* Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
* Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.

For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
* Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
